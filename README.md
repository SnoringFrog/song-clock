This is a list of songs that mention a specific time. Very sparse right now, so if you know of any songs just make an issue or a pull request. If AM/PM isn't explicitly stated in the song, it will be inferred. Multiple times from the same song are ok.

I had a bit of a list myself, then I merged that with some of the content from Craig Griffen's list from [Human Clock](http://www.humanclock.com/songlist.php). I fixed some stuff that seemed incorrect in his, assigned some ambiguous tracks to AM or PM, and added some stuff that may have been too small/obscure for him to include on his list.
